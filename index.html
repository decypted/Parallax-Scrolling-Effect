                    The people of the Great Zimbabwe Empire held a deep reverence for a supreme deity called Mwari.

Beliefs that would encompassed matters like rainmaking, agricultural fertility, and even health.

                    At its core, the empire operated under a hereditary monarchy, where power remained within a single elite family. This monarch ruled with authority and tradition.

                    Additionally, there was a council, we will referred to as the "parliament," comprised of influential people from families closely tied to the monarch. These people played advisory roles, contributing to the empire's governance.

                    Aswell as that, In order manage the diverse regions within the empire, regional governors were appointed directly by the king. This i believe is to allowed for a balance between central authority and regional autonomy, to ensure unity and stability.
