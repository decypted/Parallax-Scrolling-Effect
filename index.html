                    The people of the Great Zimbabwe Empire held a deep reverence for a supreme deity called Mwari. Their spiritual connection with Mwari was facilitated through intermediaries known as "mhondoros" and "svikiros," who acted as essentially bridges between the divine and the mortal realm. Beliefs that would encompassed matters like rainmaking, agricultural fertility, and even health.

                    At its core, the empire operated under a hereditary monarchy, where power remained within a single elite family. This monarch ruled with authority and tradition.

                    Additionally, there was a council, we will referred to as the "parliament," comprised of influential people from families closely tied to the monarch. These people played advisory roles, contributing to the empire's governance.

                    Aswell as that, In order manage the diverse regions within the empire, regional governors were appointed directly by the king. This i believe is to allowed for a balance between central authority and regional autonomy, to ensure unity and stability.

                    While Great Zimbabwe is not typically associated with technological advancements and there is a lack of source on their technological developments, it likely played a significant role in trade and culture during its time. The rulers of Great Zimbabwe likely regulated the thriving medieval gold trade becsuse of its strategic location between the northern gold fields and the Indian Ocean.

                    The archaeological site at Great Zimbabwe consists of several sections. The first section is the Hill Complex, it is a series of structural ruins sit atop the steepest hill of the site. Believed to have been the religious center of the site. The Hill Complex is the oldest part of Great Zimbabwe, and shows signs of construction that date to around 900 C.E. And the ruins of the second section, Is The Great Enclosure. It is a walled, circular area below the Hill Complex dating to the 14th century. Historians generally cited that the walls were built without mortar, as it relies on carefully shaped rocks to hold the wall’s shape on their own. Altough the function of this enclosure is unknown, archeologists suggest it could have been a royal residence or a symbolic grain storage facility.

                    Historians believe that the empire had a highly stratified society with distinct roles for farmers, livestock herders, artisans, and ordinary laborers.

                    The kingdom had a rigid three-tiered structure.

                    The city also had a unique tax structure that enabled citizens to pay for tax with their labour if there was a financial constraint. The unique labour-for-tax system contributed immensely to building the great walls and towers of Great Zimbabwe.

                    Historians surmise that Great Zimbabwe was a "highly stratified society", with farmers, livestock herders, artisans, and ordinary laborers fulfilling distinct roles; This divisions usually reflected a social order governed by a strong, centralized authority 

                    Particularly, of the main methods of acquiring power in this society was the ownership of cattle, a tradition spanning to modern day africa still to this day! The number of wives a man had was another indicator of success because it corresponded to the labor at his disposal. Women were expected to sow, tend crops, harvest them, prepare food, and fetch water. Unmarried males hunted, herded animals, and made clothings.

                    Has Great Zimbabwe Empire as a rich trading history. Fragments of blue and white Chinese porcelain have been discovered at the site, along with local pottery. This suggests that Great Zimbabwe was part of an Indian Ocean trading network, even though it is located about 300 miles from the ocean.

                    The empire thrived on cattle herding, gold mining, and commerce with the Swahili port city of Sofala on the Indian Ocean. 
                   
                   Great Zimbabwe exported gold and ivory to cities like Sofala and Kilwa Kisanwani on the East African coast. From there, these goods were carried to the Persian Gulf, India, and China.
                   
                   In exchange for these goods, Great Zimbabwe’s elites imported luxury items such as stoneware, colored glass beads, and cotton
                   
                   The artefacts found at Great Zimbabwe demonstrate that a society with extensive trading links existed here generations before Europeans exercised their colonial domination on Africa.

                The decline of the Great Zimbabwe empire was a result of several interconnected factors such as the southern Shift of the Center of Trade. The center of trade shifted southwards, which lead to the abandonment of Zimbabwe during the 15th century. This shift was likely due to the desire to maximize profit where trade had become more active.Aswell as that, Civil Wars and Succession Disputes played a role as the empire was plagued by civil wars and succession disputes, which often led to factionalism. Moreover, there was a significant decline in trade, especially compared to sites further north. This could be attributed to exhaustion of gold mines and the shift in trade routes.And shortage of resources due to overpopulation that current technology couldn't sustain which led to shortages of resources such as pastures and arable land for farming which further strained the empire’s resources. Lastly, but defintely not the last reason as it is highly complex, the refusal to pay tribute as Vassal chiefs refused to pay tribute, undermining the political structure of the empire.
